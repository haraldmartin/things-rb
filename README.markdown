things-rb
=========

things-rb is a Ruby library and a command line tool for accessing the backend of the GTD app [Things.app](http://culturedcode.com/things/)

## Why?
There are many reasons why you would use a command line version of Things, including: 

![GeekTools](http://img.skitch.com/20090323-xacfsghrsi7p6yjt1x2fnse8ek.jpg)

- Keep a list of your ToDos on the desktop using an app like [GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/)
- Access your ToDos remotely by SSH:ing into your machine (even from a Windows or Linux box)
- You don't need to have Things.app running all the time
- You like the Terminal and command line

## Install

    $ gem install things-rb

If you're on default Mac OS X Leopard and haven't upgraded your RubyGem installation you'll need to to this first:

    $ gem update --system

When the upgrade is done, just run the `gem install ...` command above and you're set.


## Usage

things-rb can be used either as a Ruby library or with the included command line tool. 

### Ruby Library

Example usage:

    things = Things.new # will use Things' default database location. 
    # things = Things.new(:database => '/path/to/Database.xml')
    
    tasks = things.today.map do |task|
      tags    = "(#{task.tags.join(' ')})" if task.tags?
      project = "[#{task.parent}]" if task.parent?
      [task.bullet, task.title, tags, project].compact.join(" ")
    end
    
    puts tasks.compact.sort.join("\n")
    
### Command Line Use

    $ things
    $ things --help
    
Shows all the options available. 

The most common use I assume would be:
    
    $ things today
  
which lists all tasks in "Today" which are not already completed.
    
If you like to show completed and canceled tasks, just pass the `--all` option
        
    $ things --all today

Be default, things-rb will use the default location of the Things' database but if you keep it somewhere else you can
set a custom path using the `-d` or `--database` switch

    $ things --database /path/to/Database.xml

Replace `today` with other focus to list the task

    $ things --all next
    $ things logbook


## Testing

To view test document (`test/fixtures/Database.xml`) in Things, just launch Things.app with ⌥ (option/alt) down and click "Choose Library" and point it to `things-rb/test/fixtures`. 
Be sure to disable automatic logging of completed tasks in the Things.app preferences so they won't be moved around in the document.

To play nice with other package managers than Rubygems, the command line tool (`bin/things`) and the tests `test/test_helper.rb` *don't* `require 'rubygems'` before `require 'hpricot'`. So if hpricot isn't in your path you need to run the tests slightly different. 

`RUBYOPT=rubygems rake` works for me to load hpricot and the other required gems, but still test the local things version (i.e. not the gem).

Run the local command line tool using `ruby -r rubygems -I lib bin/things`. 

Of course you can just add the require statements in your code in development without committing them.


## TODO
- Support "Projects" focus
- Optimize test and XML queries
- Organize the classes, make internal methods private
